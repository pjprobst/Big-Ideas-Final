    "# Introduction\n",
    "I tried to find the best neighborhoods in Pittsburgh based on Traffic Consistency. Inconsistent traffic flow is a major risk factor that leads to collisions and reduced pedestrian comfort and safety. My goal is to identify neighborhoods where the those who drive through it drive the most consistent to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure stability, I used a traffic dataset to calculate the **Top 50% Speed Spread** for each road segment. This metric measures the difference between the **85th Percentile Speed** (the speed of the fast drivers) and the **50th Percentile Speed** (the speed of the average driver).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The core metric is the **Average Speed Spread Score**:\n",
    "- A low score means the 85th percentile drivers are close to the median drivers, showing high consistency and predictable flow (safest/best).\n",
    "- A high score means the fast drivers are much faster than the average drivers, showing low consistency and unstable flow (riskiest/worst).\n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook walks through the steps I used to:\n",
    "- Load the traffic dataset.\n",
    "- Calculate the Top 50% Speed Spread for each road segment.\n",
    "- Aggregate the average spread score for each neighborhood.\n",
    "- Identify the most stable and most inconsistent neighborhoods."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Traffic flow is most stable and safe in **Friendship** (score $1.00$) and **Upper Hill** ($3.07$)—the $\\text{Median}$ and $\\text{85}^\\text{th}$ percentiles are really close, so everyone drives the same speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar** ($6.50$) and **Strip District** ($6.33$) are the worst because the fast drivers are way faster than the average drivers, making the traffic totally inconsistent and risky."
